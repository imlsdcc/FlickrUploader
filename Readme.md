This repository contains a vb.net solution for batch uploading directories of image files to Flickr using the FlickrNet library and Flickr's API. In addition, this Visual Studio project can batch parse associated xml files (such as those that describe the digital objects in a CONTENTdm or similar CMS) and upload the image metadata to Flickr during the batch process. It can also be given a text file containing a standard description block to append to the Flickr description metadata block.
